I am a research fellow (pre-doc) at Robert Bosch Centre for DS and AI ([RBCDSAI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/)) at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I am advised by [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/). My current research interests are continual reinforcement learning and generalization in deep learning. 

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Sprinklr](https://www.sprinklr.com/). I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2022 where I completed dual degree with a master's in AI and Data Science associated with [CMInDS](https://www.minds.iitb.ac.in/), a bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, and a minor in Computer Science.
